            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>My name is Kelsey Burke and I am from Pasadena, California. I am currently a student at the University of Michigan School of Kinesiology pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Applied Exercise Science with a Sport Management concentration. My goal is to work in the health and fitness industry after my expected graduation date in May of 2022.</p>
            <p>I have experience in both coaching and program design, as I spent two years coaching competitive gymnastics at Club Champion Gymnastics and recently earned my personal trainer certification through the National Academy of Sports Medicine. In addition, I interned for Train Like A Gymnast this past summer, where I worked firsthand on the creation of the Stretch Like A Gymnast exercise program. Following the success of my internship, I accepted a part-time position and am continuing as Project Manager this fall.</p>
            <p>While still a student, I am passionate about promoting health and fitness to those around me. </p>
